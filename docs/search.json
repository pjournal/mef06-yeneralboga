    "text": "Hello all ! I am Yener Alboğa . Although I entered 2009, I graduated from Boğaziçi University Industrial Engineering in 2020(No typo just 5 years deviation from expected graduation year:) Besides, I have about 9 years of professional work experience. The first 3-4 years of this are in the supply chain. After that, I worked in Quick commerce and e-commerce companies for catalogue& category management analysis. Currently, I am working as a consultant on catalogue management to a company called Zoodmall, which is trying to sell products from Turkey and China as B2C to MENA and CIS countries. At the same time, I am a seller who tries to sell products with fulfilled by merchant and Retail arbitrage model on eBay, AliExpress and Amazon. With the development of my Data Science skills, I aim to carry out productive and creative work in companies that I will work in the field of e-commerce in the medium term. In the long term, I aim to have a business that I can manage independently of location from anywhere in the world by establishing an e-commerce model with a high level of efficiency.\nMy LinkedIn Profile"

    "text": "1.3 Some Interesting R Posts\nI think it is very fun and valuable to be able to analyse with R and twitter. It’s important to be able to do this as an influencer or as a policy follower etc. We can see why which tweet gets the most engagement and how it reaches larger audiences or in which time frame it will get more engagement etc. (I don’t know fancy wording for peak time of social media but for radio channels it’s called “drive time”.)\nSocial Network Analysis\nThere is a recommendation library to analyse data in R which can help us to upsell or recommend new song that we think the user might like by looking at their historical data. #recommenderlab Netflix has established a recommendation system using more than 20000 variables. These variables consider the viewing habits of users with similar characteristics, as well as variables such as user data, region and the year of production of the film’s actors.\nRecommendation Engine\nWe understood the importance of logistics even better during the pandemic and the global crisis that followed. Logistics systems have very heavy costs. Therefore, finding the optimum is very valuable. If we explain this with current examples, the decision of Getir, Yemeksepeti and Bisu dark store locations or Trendyol Express distribution points is of great importance in increasing the efficiency of the warehouse. (Example: Rental expenses, ease of access to the supplier or distance to the customer) Below link has very basic calculation for finding/deciding warehouse locations but some with maps libraries and variables we can develop a great GIS tool.\nMonte Carlo Simulation for Warehouse Allocation Using R\nThank You !"

In addition, a large part of the sports economy consists of support from fans and TV broadcasting revenues. In addition, creating a schedule where athletes can rest as much as possible and as evenly as possible is very important for both athlete health and fair competition."

    "text": "3.2 Constraints\nThe fact that each team should not play consecutive matches in their own field or away, that the match times of the big teams should not overlap with each other, that the teams that have matches outside the local league on weekdays can rest as equally as possible between the 3 matches they will play in a week are among the important constraints of this case. And there are other constraints like matching the most interesting games to available TV slots, minimizing total driving distances."

    "text": "3.3 Result\nAs an example, let’s take the team of Bayern Munich, which also plays in the Euroleague. Let’s assume that the Beko Basketball League matches are played on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Likewise, Euroleague matches are played on Thursday - Friday. In this case, it would not be healthy for Bayern Münich to play the Euroleauge game on Thursday and then play the domestic league game on Friday. At the same time, if he played the Euroleague game away, he must play the domestic league game at home so that he has the opportunity to rest at the maximum level. This was just a regular 1 week example for 1 team.\nNow lets consider that Basketball Bundesliga is the premier basketball league in Germany with 18 teams and over 300 games each season.\nAnd with correct objective function & constraints The German First Division Basketball League finds scheduling solutions in less than 20 minutes for previously unsolvable models."
